    "For my capstone project, I have chosen to continue in a similar vein to my Phase 3 project with entirely different data. Churn, which is what it is called when a customer stops doing business with a company, is one of the largest issues facing almost every industry today. In context of subscription industries, for example, \"churn\" is a massive ongoing issue, as it is infinitely cheaper to keep existing customers than to lure in new ones."

    "Therefore, establishing a procedure to keep customers from \"churning\" is of the utmost importance. The first step in this process is identifying the reasons behind customer churn, such as dissatisfaction, area of service provided, quality of service, and other such considerations. Following that, we will build a model that will accurately predict whether or not a customer will churn, and thereby provide the limitlessly valuable opportunity for a company to prevent that churn."
